## Types of Users ##
### - Teachers ###
Teacher users are able to add users to their course, but they are not able to remove Student users. They can remove all other types. Teachers can add/edit/delete all materials and files in their course. Teachers can create as many sandbox/practice courses as they would like and are able to access all past content/courses. 

### - Guest Teachers ###
Guest Teacher users are able to do everything that a teacher user is able to do *except* add/remove any user or delete any material or file. Their roletype is purely additive. Additionally, they are able to view grades in the course but unable to modify any grades or grade assignments.
